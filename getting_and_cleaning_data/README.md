The analysis consisted of getting the train and test data from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 (information available in http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones ).
This information was merged into the same data set and  a sumarisation was performed in which all the features related to the mean and std of each measuremente were averaged.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'tidy.txt': data set with the average of each variable.

- 'run_analysis.R': Script with the code used to transform the data.

- 'avg_features.md': features contained in tidy data set, all features are just the average of the corresponding variable.
